Spectrum analyser Concerns 

User entry of data 
Freq start stop (span, centre) Bandwidth
?Set gain) 

Display - data entry keypad/buttons 

Display 
Display scan, data entered 

ADC 
initialize 
Decode data from Log det 

PLL 
Main YIG driver/PLL
Secondary PLL for fine control ?FM coil on YIG or second LO

Calculate freq/PLL data based on data entered including limits 

Capture screenshots => USB 

Marker(s) catch freq/level data 

Entities 
Level
- individual measurements from ADC => [array of values] ? 200/scan 
- freq start
- freq stop 
=> derive span, centre 
- step size = (freq start - freq stop)/200
- marker [freq,level]

Pseudocode
setup start,stop,span, centre,step, marker

while start

for i in range(0,200) # 200 steps/scan
    data=> PLL 
    read ADC => data array 
    data+ step 
    display data 
    update marker = display if changed
    
clear data
        
Interrupt driven 
change freq/RBW
